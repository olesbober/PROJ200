COMSC-200 Semester Project.

-by Roderic Deichler and Oles Bober

-first successful run on May 15th, 2017

This project is a virtual simulation of the DVC parking lot, from Week 1 until Finals Week.
The simulation runs hour-by-hour. Every hour, students park in a lot according to what class they have.
The weekday has been trimmed to 5 days and the number of hours in a day has been set to 14. Thus the simulation
runs on a 70 hour week. 

Currently, a visual basic script fills a file with randomized student schedules that are read and parsed for data.

Any notes we need to remember can be written here.

Notes for future reference:
-The project is complete! It runs well.
