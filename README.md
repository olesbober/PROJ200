# PROJ200
COMSC-200 Semester Project.
by Roderic Deichler and Oles Bober
started May 5th, 2017

This project is a virtual simulation of the DVC parking lot, from Week 1 until Finals Week.
The simulation runs hour-by-hour.
Any notes we need to remember can be written here.

Notes for future reference:
- Added percentDrop function in simulation.cpp. This function drops the given percent of students from the total enrolled.
- Added the cases for students dropping in the main while loop.
- I also just realized that isStudent is now useless. We can talk about this later.
Nothing else to report.
