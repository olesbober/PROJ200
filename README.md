# PROJ200
COMSC-200 Semester Project.
by Oles Bober and Rod Deichler
started May 5th, 2017

This project is a virtual simulation of the DVC parking lot, from Week 1 until Finals Week.
The simulation runs hour-by-hour.
Any notes we need to remember can be written here.

Notes for future reference:
- Add exception handling in Student.h
- Not done with ParkingLot.h. It seems more complicated than I imagined it to be: 2-D array are hard to make.
